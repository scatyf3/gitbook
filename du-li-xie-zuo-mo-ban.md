## 要点段

主题句+解释+过渡+例子。

> **To begin with, there are many more ways for students to learn nowadays, which means they are less reliant on teachers than in the past.【主题句】**
>
> **​ A few years ago, children could only ​**​**acquire new skills**​**​ by going to school and attending classes**, so they respected their teachers a lot. **In contrast**, now they can easily use technology to learn independently. 【解释】
>
> My personal experience is a compelling illustration of this. 【过渡】
>
> For the past five years, **I have studied** English almost every single day. **Although** my native language is Korean, I am able to easily communicate in English without feeling any anxiety. I expand my vocabulary by using a smartphone application that teaches me new phrases twice per day, **and** I practice pronunciation by watching videos on the Internet. \*\* Consequently\*\*, I feel like old-fashioned classes with a teacher are not as important as they used to be. ​**​If I had tried​**​ to\*\* become proficient in\*\* English twenty years ago, I would have **depended** on a teacher and respected her a lot.\*\*【例子】

> ​**Furthermore**​\*\*, teachers are no longer strict, which means children **don’t** fear them at all. \*\*If **teachers fail to discipline students when they misbehave, they do not feel obligated to respect them.** **This problem is very common nowadays. For instance, a few months ago my little brother used profanity when addressing his math teacher. Surprisingly, he wasn’t punished for this terrible behavior. His teacher was afraid of how our parents would react to my brother being punished, ​​so​​ he just ignored it.** **Since then**, my brother **hasn’t respected that teacher at all**, and is often quite rude. **In addition**, a lot of his classmates have picked up on the fact that they can get away with impolite behavior and have started acting up as well. **Based on this experience**, I strongly feel that young people do not respect **educators** like they did in the past.

TIPS：

在编写正文段落时，请记住以下几点：

* 混合使用简单句、复合句和复杂句。 这在评分标准中被称为“句法多样性”。
* 强调例子。 它们很容易写，所以它们应该占每个正文段落的 60%（或更多）。 如果你强调它们，你会犯更少的错误。
* 避免使用非常短的句子（少于 7 个单词）和非常长的句子（超过 60 个单词）。
* 不要以并列连词开头句子。 电子评分员似乎不喜欢这个。
* 使用各种话语短语（因此，此外，结果，另外等）。(therefore, moreover, as a result, in addition, etc)
* 每个正文段落写大约 ​\*\*150 个单词 \*\*​。

## 结论

* **Sentence One: Restate the Thesis**\
  Paraphrase your thesis. Begin with “​\*\*In conclusion, I strongly feel that…\*\*​“.
* **Sentence Two: Restate the Two Reasons**\
  Just use: “​**This is because \_\_**​**\_\_**​**\_\_, and \_**​**\_\_**​**\_\_**​\*\*\_\_.\*\*​“
